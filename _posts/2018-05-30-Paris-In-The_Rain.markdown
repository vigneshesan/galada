All I know is (ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
We could go anywhere, we could do<br/>
Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in<br/>
Yeah all I know is (ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
Getting lost late at night, under stars<br/>
Finding love standing right where we are, your lips<br/>
They pull me in the moment<br/>
You and I alone and<br/>
People may be watching, I don't mind<br/>
'Cause anywhere with you feels right<br/>
Anywhere with you feels like<br/>
Paris in the rain<br/>
Paris in the rain<br/>
We don't need a fancy town<br/>
Or bottles that we can't pronounce<br/>
'Cause anywhere, babe<br/>
Is like Paris in the rain<br/>
When I'm with you ooh ooh ooh<br/>
When I'm with you ooh ooh ooh<br/>
Paris in the rain<br/>
Paris in the rain<br/>
I look at you now and I want this forever<br/>
I might not deserve it but there's nothing better<br/>
Don't know how I ever did it all without you<br/>
My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest<br/>
Feelings they come and they go, that they do<br/>
Feelings they come and they go, not with you<br/>
The late nights<br/>
And the street lights<br/>
And the people<br/>
Look at me girl<br/>
And the whole world could stop<br/>
Anywhere with you feels right<br/>
Anywhere with you feels like<br/>
Paris in the rain<br/>
Paris in the rain<br/>
We don't need a fancy town<br/>
Or bottles that we can't pronounce<br/>
'Cause anywhere, babe<br/>
Is like Paris in the rain<br/>
When I'm with you ooh ooh<br/>
When I'm with you ooh ooh<br/>
Paris in the rain<br/>
Paris in the rain<br/>
Oh<br/>
Girl, when I'm not with you<br/>
All I do is miss you<br/>
So come and set the mood right<br/>
Underneath the moonlight<br/>
(Days in Paris<br/>
Nights in Paris)<br/>
Paint you with my eyes closed<br/>
Wonder where the time goes<br/>
(Yeah, isn't it obvious?<br/>
Isn't it obvious?)<br/>
So come and set the mood right<br/>
Underneath the moonlight<br/>
'Cause anywhere with you feels right<br/>
Anywhere with you feels like<br/>
Paris in the rain<br/>
Paris in the rain<br/>
Walking down an empty street<br/>
Puddles underneath our feet<br/>
