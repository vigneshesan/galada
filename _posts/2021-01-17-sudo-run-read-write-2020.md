I am not a voracious reader who dwells in books, the number of books I have read after college would be in single digits.  
  
This new year I received 2 books as a gift from my beloved team at [FORGE Accelerator](https://www.linkedin.com/company/forge-innovation-accelerator/), The books were curated with specific outcomes and I really wanted to take this chance to develop reading as a habit.  
  
A few months back we had a Burnout Audit done by [Dorai Thodla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAC1_4BMMV1jUEpODQvW_jTBsPVdGfh5Xg) who recommended Rework by [Basecamp](https://www.linkedin.com/company/37signals/) to help me restructure my way of work to achieve efficiency. Atomic Habits by [James Clear](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACvaFcgBPQXx9zFpXphNYbTEHa1u-inz5d8) was one from my new year gift.  
  
These two books really had what I wanted. First, the routines and way I work needed an upgrade, for which I was in need to let go of some practices that I was following, then develop new ones.  
  
I am writing this post out of sheer excitement of what a gift can deliver and the drive it has created for me. Writing/blogging was another habit I wanted to develop, hence this post as an initiative. I guess developing an affinity towards reading books and identifying a good hobby rather than extended screentime in the night provided me with a lot of benefits in the past few days.
